This mod aims to completely revamp Aground's movement to resemble ULTRAKILL's.
A lot of inspiration for this was taken from RETROKILL, and some of the code/implementations were taken from ULTRAKILL's decompiled code.

In a technical sense, this mod functions by using listeners to read inputs, and using <code>stopImmediatePropagation()</code> to stop the normal evaluation of that input. 

<i>Almost</i> all of the code in this mod was written by me, and all of the sprites/animations used were made by me too, but credits for specific parts can be found in the related code (or mod.io page if this ever releases :P)</br>
To anyone that is reading this:
Feel free to take <b>ANY</b> code or sprite you want from this project, no need to credit me any place (I would however like it if you wrote a small comment before the code you take saying its mine :D)

Thank you for trying this mod, and thanks for (probably) checking out the code that I am very proud of.
Have fun!
